# Webdev-2021-Final-Project
Final Project for the Introduction to Web-development class at Portland State University

Built using JS, Html 5, and CSS.

I decided to stick mostly to what I knew when making this website. Of course I was fumbling about like a fish
with it's head cut off for a while but after getting the hang of it, it became much easier. Most of the term
was a "Use it and forget about it" kind of mentality from me, but once I started working on this assignment it
all came back and was super important to know the little things that you could use to make the page nice.

I mostly use plain CSS and html, but I do use CSS Grid for previous work experience as that is really the only
section in the entire assignment that needs some additional work. The thought of using bootstrap crossed my mind,
but I didn't even really know what I wanted my website to look like, so using bootstrap felt like a waste of time
until I got that down pat. I will try to implement bootstrap, but I would only really use it for the navbar,
everything else already looks like how I want them too.

The website is hosted using github pages, and the link is:https://ebrunswick.github.io/Webdev-2021-Final-Project/

I decided to build take an old school approach to this project simply because I would rather build a personal
website once I have the front end skills and time needed to build one correctly. Simply put, I lack design
experience, I lack personal projects and external projects, and I lack the tools and requirements to build
a website I would use. I will build one eventually, but I will need some time to build the projects and other
things.
