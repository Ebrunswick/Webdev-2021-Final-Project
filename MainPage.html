          <p>Hello Everyone! I am Evan Brunswick, and I am an SDET(Software Developer in Test) at Mosaic Finance. I am currently working towards my
            Bachellor's degree in Computer Science At 
            <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State Univerisity</a> 
            Portland State Univerisity in Portland Oregon, USA.
            <br><br>
            Before my current position at Mosaic Finance, I interned at Inseego USA where I was doing manual and automation quality assurance(QA)
            for new features, bug fixes, and also some database changes if the need ever arose. I also worked on creating a dashboard for the QA team
            where it would record production failures to be collected and sorted for triage.
            <br><br>
            My hobbies Include learning foreign languages, cooking, and travelling. I plan on picking up photography once I graduate as a way to 
            get into graphics processing and analysis.

          <h2>Computer Graphics - Amusement Park Project</h2>
          <p>This project was done for the CS447P/557 Introduction to Computer Graphics class at Portland State Univerisity.
            The assignment was to create an amusement park from scratch using a framework called openGL. We were provided a
            flat terrain and a b-spline for a roller coaster. Our goal was to create several objects in the environment that
            would be seen at an amusement park and generate them with openGL. All aspects including texturing and positioning
            were part of the project. Users could also add custom models created in Blender, but would have to write a class to
            interpret the files.

          <h2>Capstone Project - Supply Chain Security and CTF</h2>
          <p>While done as a group, this is the project my group undertook and developed for Capstone.
            The project was to create a CTF game with codelabs that would show off what a supply chain attack is, how they are performed
            by an attacker, and how to best defend against them. The sponsor for this is Professor Wu-chang at Portland State Univerisity
            and the CTF game will be used as additional teaching material for his students and others at PSU.
